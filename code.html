<p>Here you can find some of the programs I have written over the
years, including both frequently maintained projects and some
relatively obscure ones, or small code snippets that I find
useful.</p>

<h3>Active projects</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/">Grabcartoons</a></strong>
is a program for fetching web comics and putting them all in a single
page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mac projects on hold</h3>

<p>These are projects in which I am in principle still interested, but
since they are Mac software and I am at the moment without a Mac, they
have not been updated recently, and may not work in recent versions of
the software they support.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/things2thl/">things2thl</a></strong>
is a script for transferring data
from <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>
to <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">The Hit
List</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/copperexport/">CopperExport</a></strong>
is a plugin for exporting photos from iPhoto to
a <a href="http://coppermine.sf.net/">Coppermine</a> gallery.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Old projects</h3>

<p>These are projects or code which I have no interest in maintaining
anymore, but which some people may still find useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="brt/2006/02/26/bolimonitor-a-contraction-monitoring-program/index.html">BoliMonitor</a></strong>
is a very simple program to measure duration and interval of
contractions during pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
