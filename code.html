<p>Here you can find some of the programs I have written over the
years, including both frequently maintained projects and some
relatively obscure ones, or small code snippets that I find
useful.</p>

<h3>Active projects</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/">Grabcartoons</a></strong>
is a program for fetching web comics and putting them all in a single
page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mac projects on hold</h3>

<p>These are projects in which I am in principle still interested, but
since they are Mac software and I am at the moment without a Mac, they
have not been updated recently, and may not work in recent versions of
the software they support.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/things2thl/">things2thl</a></strong>
is a script for transferring data
from <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>
to <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">The Hit
List</a>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://zzamboni.org/copperexport/">CopperExport</a></strong>
is a plugin for exporting photos from iPhoto to
a <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">Coppermine</a>
gallery.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Old projects</h3>

<p>These are projects or code which I have no interest in maintaining
anymore, but which some people may still find useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="brt/2006/02/26/bolimonitor-a-contraction-monitoring-program/index.html">BoliMonitor</a></strong>
is a very simple Mac program to measure duration and interval of
contractions during pregnancy.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://mailer.sf.net/">Mailer</a></strong> is a
program written in Perl for managing user's email redirection and very
simple mailing lists. It's very environment-specific and very old
(written in 1999), and while I still think it's cool (and as far as I
know, it's still being used
at <a href="http://cerias.purdue.edu/">CERIAS</a>, where it
originated), it's been largely superseded by IMAP and easy-to-use list
management programs. Plus it keeps its DB in a plain text file, so it
doesn't scale very well once you have a large number of lists.</li>

</ul>
