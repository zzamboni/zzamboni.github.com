<p><b>Who:</b> I am a computer scientist, programmer, and overall geek living in
Mexico with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.</p> 

<p><b>What:</b> I work at <a href="http://cfengine.com/">CFEngine
AS</a>, makers of the amazing
tool <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">CFEngine</a>. My
official title is "Senior Security Advisor", which means I work on
getting CFEngine to be better as a security tool, and also on
spreading the word about its capabilities in this area. In practice I
do a lot of things, including community work, writing, speaking at
conferences, visiting customers, etc. My main fields of knowledge are
computer security, virtualization and configuration management.</p>

<p><b>Where:</b> I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life. When I
was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different
cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my
Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>
under the direction of <a href="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/">Gene
Spafford</a>. Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go
to Switzerland, where I worked at
the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Zurich Research
Lab</a>. After eight years, we
<a href="/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html">moved
back to Mexico</a> in late 2009.</p>

<p><b>Long version:</b> If you are interested, here's
my <a href="/vita.html">curriculum
vitae</a>. For other useless trivia about me,
see <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>The online past:</b> I had a blog
called <a href="/brt/index.html">BrT</a> which I closed when I moved
back to Mexico. I still keep a <a href="/brt/index.html">static
copy</a> of it for reference. I also still have
a <a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~zamboni/">web page at
Purdue University</a>, with extremely old content.</p>

<h3>About this site</h3>

<p>What you (hopefully) see as the
single <a href="http://zzamboni.org/">zzamboni.org</a> site actually
comes from several different sources. Both of my blogs
(<a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/">Ideally Blue</a>
and <a href="http://posterous.zzamboni.org/">zznippets</a>) are served
on their own subdomains
by <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>, a fantastic online
service that makes it extremely easy to post content via email and to
share it in many different ways. The rest of the site is served
by <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> through their incredibly
useful <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> feature. All the
"top" pages are stored in the
main <a href="https://github.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.github.com">zzamboni.github.com</a>
repository, which is devoted to this content. Most of
my <a href="http://zzamboni.org/code.html">project</a> pages are
stored in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of their own github
repositories. Since GitHub Pages supports custom domains, all of them
can be transparently hosted under the zzamboni.org domain.</p>

<p>I think it's incredible that all of this infrastructure is so easy
to use and available for free. I am a paying GitHub customer, but
mostly as a way to give something back to such a wonderful
service.</p>
