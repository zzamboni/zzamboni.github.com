<p>There's probably more interesting stuff to see (or
not) <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/">elsewhere</a> <a href="http://posterous.zzamboni.org/">around</a>
here. You've been warned.</p>

<p>I (Diego Zamboni) am a computer scientist living in Mexico with my
wife Susana and our
daughters <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2006/02/16/karina-aileen/index.html">Karina</a>
and <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2008/09/08/fabiola-aimee/index.html">Fabiola</a>.
We recently moved back to Mexico from Switzerland, where I worked at
the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Zurich Research Lab</a>,
and before that we lived in the U.S., where I studied
at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>, I
still have a <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/zamboni/">web
page there</a>.</p>

<p>I currently work
at <a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/mx/es/cs/home.html">HP
Mexico</a> as an Outsourcing consultant. My main fields of knowledge
are computer security, virtualization and configuration
management.</p>

<p>I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life. When I
was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in 4 different cities
before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. After that, we decided to
go to Switzerland. After 8 years, we decided
to <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html">come
back to Mexico</a>.</p>

<p>So there. Maybe some more later when I'm more inspired.</p>

<p>If you are interested, here's
my <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/about/vita/index.html">curriculum
vitae</a>. For other useless trivia about me,
see <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I had a blog
called <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/index.html">BrT</a> which
I closed when I moved my blogging to the
wonderful <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>. I still keep
a <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/index.html">static copy</a> of
it for reference.</p>
