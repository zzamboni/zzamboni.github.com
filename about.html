---

<p>I am a computer scientist, programmer, and overall geek living in
Mexico with my awesome wife Susana and our
daughters <a href="/brt/2006/02/16/karina-aileen/index.html">Karina</a>
and <a href="/brt/2008/09/08/fabiola-aimee/index.html">Fabiola</a>.</p>

<p>I work
at <a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/mx/es/cs/home.html">HP
Mexico</a> as an Outsourcing Consultant. My main fields of knowledge
are computer security, virtualization
and <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">configuration
management</a>.</p>

<p>I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life. When I
was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different
cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my
Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>
under the direction of <a href="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/">Gene
Spafford</a>. Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go
to Switzerland, where I worked at
the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Zurich Research
Lab</a>. After eight years, we
<a href="/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html">moved
back to Mexico</a> in late 2009.</p>

<p>If you are interested, here's
my <a href="/brt/about/vita/index.html">curriculum
vitae</a>. For other useless trivia about me,
see <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I had a blog
called <a href="/brt/index.html">BrT</a> which
I closed when I moved my blogging to the
amazing <a href="http://posterous.com/">posterous.com</a>. I still
keep a <a href="/brt/index.html">static copy</a> of it for reference.</p>
