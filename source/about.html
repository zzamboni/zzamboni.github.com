<p><strong>Who:</strong> I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer,
  sysadmin, author, and overall geek living in Mexico with my awesome
  wife and our two beautiful daughters.</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> At the moment <strong>I am looking for a
 job!</strong> If you are looking for someone with excellent analytical,
 problem solving, teaching, writing, public speaking and research abilities, please
 check out <a href="/vita.html">my resume</a>
 or <a href="http://mx.linkedin.com/in/zzamboni">my LinkedIn profile</a> and let me know if you'd like to talk to me. I am also
 the author of <a href="http://cf-learn.info">"Learning CFEngine 3"</a>, published by O'Reilly Media.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> I was born in Argentina, but have moved around all my life. When I
was very young I moved to Mexico, where I lived in four different
cities before moving to the U.S. to pursue my
Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>
under the direction of <a href="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/">Gene Spafford</a>. Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go
to Switzerland, where I worked at
the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Zurich Research Lab</a>. After eight years, we
<a href="/brt/2009/09/08/going-home/index.html">moved back to Mexico</a> in late 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> If you are interested, here's
my <a href="/vita.html">curriculum vitae</a>. For other useless trivia about me,
see <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/03/07/blog-tagged/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The online past:</strong> I had a blog
called <a href="/brt/index.html">BrT</a> which I closed when I moved
back to Mexico. I still keep a <a href="/brt/index.html">static copy</a> of it for reference. I also still have
a <a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~zamboni/">web page at Purdue University</a>, with extremely old content.</p>

<h3>About this site</h3>

<p>This entire site is served
by <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> through their incredibly
useful <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> feature. All the
"top" pages are stored in the
main <a href="https://github.com/zzamboni/zzamboni.github.com">zzamboni.github.com</a>
repository, which is devoted to this content. Most of
my <a href="http://zzamboni.org/code.html">project</a> pages are
stored in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of their own github
repositories. Since GitHub Pages supports custom domains, all of them
can be transparently hosted under the zzamboni.org domain.</p>

<p>I think it's incredible that all of this infrastructure is so easy
to use and available for free. I am a paying GitHub customer, but
mostly as a way to give something back to such a wonderful
service.</p>
