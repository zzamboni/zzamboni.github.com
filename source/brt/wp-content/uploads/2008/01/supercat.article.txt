     Super Cataloger 128 by Diego Martin Zamboni
     
     
     
     Catalog all of your software (up to as many as 2500 titles) quickly
     and efficiently with this great utility for the 128! 80-column monitor
     require. Printer optional.
     
     
     Super Cataloger 128 has two modes of operation: in Directory mode, you
     view the directory of one disk, select which files you will add to the
     main list, add them, and perform other operations. In List mode you
     view the list itself, which contains all the files you have added, and
     perform tasks like sorting, searching, deleting, and so on.
     
        When you first run Super Cataloger 128, you will see the main
     screen. It's divided in four sections. The top line contains the name
     of the program and some information I'll describe later. The middle
     section is the work place, which contains the filenames either from
     the directory or from the list. The bottom three lines contain the
     menu with the options you have at the moment, and the message and
     input line. As you have no files in memory either from a directory or
     from a list, you will see an almost empty screen. A message on the
     bottom line (the message and input line), says "Press R or L to
     continue". Pressing ESC here will exit you from the program without
     confirmation. If you look at the menu lines, you'll see that R
     corresponds to Read Dir, and L to Load List. If you press R, SC128
     will read the directory from the disk in the drive and put you in
     directory mode. On the other hand, if you press L, SC128 will ask you
     for a file name and will look for a list with that name in the disk,
     and if found, will load it and put you directly into list mode.
     
     
     DIRECTORY MODE
     
     When you press R, SC128 will read the directory from the disk in the
     drive and show the filenames in a four-column format in the middle
     section of the screen. At the top line you will see the name of the
     disk and the number of files on it. At the bottom you will see a menu
     with a list of options. You activate each option by pressing the
     highlighted letter. Also, you will see the first filename in reverse
     video. This is the cursor, and you can move it around with the cursor
     keys (either set is OK). The cursor wraps around from top to bottom,
     bottom to top and to the sides. If you press RETURN over a file, it
     will turn red, indicating it's selected. Pressing RETURN over a
     selected file will deselect it. If there are more than 76 files in the
     disk, you can view the rest of them by pressing the O key, which
     stands for Other page (there can be a maximum of two pages, as the
     maximum number of files in a disk is 144). Your can move to the top of
     the page by pressing HOME. If you are already at the top of the page,
     HOME takes you to the top of the directory. 
     
         R - Read dir: This allows you to work on another disk. Simply






                                     - 1 -






     change the disk in the drive and press this letter. SC128 will erase
     the directory currently in memory and read the new one.
     
         T - Toggle all files: This will invert the status of all the files
     in the current directory. Selected files will be deselected, and
     deselected files will be selected. If you wish to select all but a few
     ones of the files, simply select the ones you don't want selected and
     press T.
     
         X - Examine list: This puts you into list mode, which will be
     explained later.
     
         K - Disk Command: This allows you to send a command to the disk
     drive. Type in the command at the prompt and press RETURN. After the
     command is sent, the error channel will be read and shown, then you
     must press any key to return to the directory. If you press RETURN
     without typing anything or press ESC, no command will be sent and only
     the error channel will be read. Again, press any key to continue
     working.
     
         V - View file: If you can't remember the contents of a file this
     command can help. Simply put the cursor over it and press V. If the
     file is a BASIC program, it will list to the screen. If it's a
     sequential, user or program file containing only text, only the first
     four bytes of the file will be scrambled, and the rest of it will
     display correctly. If the file contains any other codes (for example,
     a text file from SpeedScript), strange things may appear. While the
     file is listing, you can press NO SCROLL to pause it (press NO SCROLL
     again no continue) or ESC to interrupt the listing and return to
     directory mode.
     
         E - Edit filename: This allows you to change the way a filename
     will appear in the list. For example, if you have SpeedScript on disk
     under the name "SS" for convenience in loading, you may want to expand
     it to "SpeedScript" before adding it to the list, so you may identify
     it easily. Remember, this command does not affect the name of the file
     in the disk, simply its name in memory. You can move the cursor with
     the cursor keys, and edit the filename with DEL and INST (this is true
     for any input within this program). If you press ESC instead of
     RETURN, all changes made to the filename will be discarded and it will
     be left as it was before invoking the command.
     
         CTRL-E - Edit diskname: In a similar manner to the previous
     command, this lets you edit the name of the disk as it will appear
     when added to the list. For example, you may change it to the name
     that appears in the disk label, for easily identifying the files that
     belong to it.
     
         C - Catalog files: This command will add all the selected files
     (the ones in red) to the master list in memory. This allows you to add
     files selectively. For example, if you have a game called SPACE GAME
     that loads the files SPACE.SPRITES and SPACE.ML when it's run, you
     don't want to put those "auxiliary" files in the list. Usually you






                                     - 2 -






     will only want to know which programs, not files, you have in each
     disk.
     
         If you have previously started a list and saved it to disk,
     remember to load it before starting to add more files. There is no way
     to merge two list files.
     
         When you perform the Catalog command, SC128 will check if there is
     space available in memory for adding the selected files, and will
     inform you if there isn't. In this case, save the list in memory to
     disk, erase it and start a new one. If the command is successfully
     performed, you will be informed how many files have been added to the
     list. After this, all selected files will be deselected.
     
         A - Scratch files: This allows you to do some housekeeping with
     your disks. If you discover some files that you don't need anymore,
     select them and press A. After asking you for a confirmation, SC128
     will scratch from the disk those files and will re-read the directory.
     This is the only command from SC128 which will alter mour disk files,
     so use it carefully.
     
         F - Free mem: Gives you the aproximate number of files that will
     still fit in memory. The program can't give you an exact number,
     because of the method used for storing the list. The sum of filenames
     and disknames (the number of disks you have added to the list, no
     matter how many files each one has) cannot exceed 2500. The number
     SC128 gives you is the exact space remaining if you added only disks
     with 70 files each.
     
         D - Directory: This command clears the screen and shows you the
     directory of the disk in the drive in the normal way, that is, exactly
     as it appears when you execute the DIRECTORY command from BASIC. You
     can press the NO SCROLL key to pause the listing or RUN/STOP to abort
     it (press it only once). After finishing, press any key to return to
     the directory mode.
     
         L - Load list: Asks for a filename (the default is the name of the
     last list accessed, either in a load or a save, or MASTER LIST if it's
     the first) and tries to load it from the disk. When finished loading,
     you will return to directory mode as if nothing has happened, but if
     you press X, you will see that the new list is now in memory, ready to
     be used.
     
          If there is a list already in memory, SC128 will ask you for a
     confirmation, since loading a new list will erase it. You can cancel
     the command by pressing ESC instead of RETURN or by pressing RETURN
     without a filename.
     
         S - Save list: If there is a list in memory this option asks for a
     filename (again, the default is the last name given in a save/load
     operation, or MASTER LIST if this is the first) and tries to save the
     list in memory to the disk with that name. You can cancel by pressing
     ESC or giving a null filename. If the file you specified already






                                     - 3 -






     exists in the disk, SC128 will ask if you wish to replace it. If you
     answer Y, the file will be scratched before saving the list in
     memory.
     
          SC128 automatically adds "SC." at the beginning of the filenames,
     for identification, so the maximum length of the filename you give is
     13 characters. 
     
         ESC - Quit: Simply quits the program after asking for
     confirmation. If you discover too late that you didn't really want to
     quit (or if you accidentally press RUN/STOP), type GOTO 400 and press
     RETURN for reentering the program without losing anything that was in
     memory.
     
          One command that is not in the menu is SPACE, which redraws the
     screen (this works also in list mode).
     
     
     LIST MODE
     
     If you press L from the initial screen or you press X from directory
     mode, you will be put in list mode. At the top of the screen, you will
     see the name of the list (the default is MASTER LIST) and the number
     of files on it. You will also note that the menu lines have changed,
     and so the middle section. The files are shown in two columns,
     containing the filename, the disk to which it belongs and the number
     of the disk. This number depends on the order in which the disks were
     added to the list, but it can be changed (more on this later). If
     there are no files in the list, you will see a message telling so, and
     you will only be allowed to perform the commands X, A, F and L (see
     below for explanation). If there are files in the list, you will see a
     cursor, and you can move it using the cursor keys. If there are more
     than 34 files in the list, you can see the other ones by pressing N
     (for Next page) or P (for Previous page). These commands wrap around,
     that is, if you are in the first page and press P, you will be taken
     to the last page. By the way, if you are in the last page and press N,
     you will see the first page again. At the bottom left of the screen
     you will see an indicator showing the current page. You can quickly go
     to the top of the current page with HOME. If you are already there and
     press HOME, you will move to the top of the first page. Let's see the
     description of each command, in the order they appear in the menu.
     
         CTRL-P - Print: This is the more complex part of the program. You
     will see a status bar at the bottom of the screen.
     
         Pressing C changes Columns to 40, 80 and 120, which affects the
     number of columns in which the list is printed. With D you can change
     the device for printing to 4, 5, 8 or 9. If you select 8 or 9,
     printing will be to the disk, so you will be asked for a filename at
     the time of printout. Answer with a filename, adding ",x,W" to the
     end, where x is P, S or U, depending if you wish to create a program,
     sequential or user file.
     






                                     - 4 -






         After selecting the device and number of colums, you are ready for
     printing. Pressing A will print all the list. At this time you will be
     asked if you wish to print the list as is or by disk. Pressing A will
     print the list in the order it is, in a format similar to that of the
     screen. To find how many columns will print, divide the setting of
     'Columns' by 40. Pressing B will print all the list by disk, that is,
     first all the files from disk #1, then all the files from disk #2, and
     so on. The number of columns will be Columns/20 (the double of the
     above).
     
        Pressing T at the print menu will print all the files which belong
     to the currently selected disk (the one the cursor was on at the time
     of pressing CTRL-P). In this way, if you wish to print all the files
     from one disk, simply put the cursor over any file of that disk, press
     CTRL-P, set columns and device and then press T. The filenames will be
     printed in a number of columns equal to Columns/20.
     
         With all the options (except when printing to disk), SC128 will
     divide the printout into pages, putting a header at the top of each
     page. The header contains the name of the list and the page number.
     SC128 uses the form-feed character (CHR$(12)) to jump to the next
     page. If your printer uses a different code from this, change it in
     line 2170 of the program.
     
         If you select Columns=120, the printer must be in condensed mode
     for printing properly. Some printers (mine for example) don't have
     codes for starting condensed printing (it's set by DIP switches), but
     others do have codes for that. Simply put in line 60 the proper codes
     for your printer, and SC128 will send them out automatically if you
     select 120 columns.
     
         When printing to disk, SC128 does no error checking, so be careful
     that the filename you give is a valid one, and be sure to append the
     ",x,W" part to the end. You can then print this file from another
     program, edit it with a word processor, etc.
     
         You can cancel a printout in progress by holding down ESC until
     the printer stops. With the same key you can exit from the print menu
     without printing anything.
     
         CTRL-D - Delete filename: Position the cursor over a filename you
     wish to erase from the list and press this key. SC128 will ask for
     confirmation, and if you answer Y, it will delete the file from the
     list. After deletion, you will be returned to the top of the current
     page, or to the first page if the deletion made the cursor be after
     the end of the list (this applies also to the next command).
     
        CTRL-E - Erase disk: This allows you to erase many files from one
     disk at once. When this command is executed, SC128 asks you if the
     file is Sorted or Unsorted. If you press S, SC128 will search through
     all the list (starting at the cursor, so if you wish to affect all the
     list, move first to the top of the first page) for files that belong
     to the current disk (the one under the cursor) and will erase them






                                     - 5 -






     from the list (if the list is long this may take a while, so the
     program cycles screen colors to indicate it's working). If you press
     U, SC128 will erase all consecutive files (starting at the cursor)
     which belong to the current disk. Deletion will stop at the first file
     from other disk that is encountered.
     
         When it finishes any deletion command (CTRL-E or CTRL-D), SC128
     will check to see if any files remain in the list for that disk. If
     there aren't, the disk will also be erased from the list, and all the
     other disks will be shifted down, thus changing their numbers. For
     example, if you erase all files from disk #3, after deletion disk #4
     will become #3, disk #5 will become #4, and so on.
     
         X - Exit list mode: Returns you to directory mode if there is a
     directory in memory. If there isn't, you will be returned to the first
     screen, from where you can read a directory. If you left any files in
     the list, you will see that the "Press R or L to continue" message has
     changed to "Press R or X to continue". This allows you to reenter list
     mode without having to read a directory.
     
         M - Move: With this option you can rearrange the files within the
     list. Put the cursor over a file you wish to move and press M. The
     file is put in a buffer, and it's shown at the bottom of the screen.
     Then move the cursor to the place where you want to put the file and
     press M again. The file will be moved to that place and all the files
     in between will be shifted down or up acordingly. (The RETURN key has
     exactly the same function as M.) Note that the operation performed is
     not an exchange, that is, the selected file is not exchanged with the
     other file. It's actually deleted from its original place, all
     following files are shifted down, and then it's inserted into the new
     place. You can cancel a selection (clear the buffer) by pressing ESC.
     
         E - Search: With this option you can search through the list
     (starting at the position following the cursor) for a file. After you
     press E you will be asked to enter a filename. Type the file you are
     looking for and press RETURN. If you start the filename with an
     asterisk, the search will be partial, that is, any file that contains
     the text you entered will match. If the file you requested is found,
     the cursor is moved to it. The text you entered becomes the default
     search string for the next search, so you can make multiple searches
     simply by pressing E again and then RETURN (for accepting the default
     string).
     
         A variation of this command is SHIFT-E, which allows you to search
     for a disk instead of a file. The procedure is exactly the same as for
     searching a file, but the search string you enter will be searched for
     in the disk list instead of the file list, and the cursor will be
     positioned on the first file (after the initial cursor position) that
     belongs to that disk.
     
         A - Add filename: This allows you to add an individual filename to
     the list. I find this option particularly useful for adding the names
     of commercial programs to the list. Generally, commercial disks






                                     - 6 -






     contain many files, all of them belonging to the same program. So you
     can add only the name of the program, without bothering about the
     other files. When you press A, you will be asked for the filename, and
     then the diskname (by default, the diskname is the same as the
     filename). If the diskname you entered is already in the list (for
     example, if you want to register in the list a file you have added to
     a disk already in the list), the file will be added to it, and you
     will be notified. If the diskname you enter is not in the list (in the
     case of a commercial program), the disk will be added to the list
     along with the filename.
     
         G - Goto page: This allows you to home in directly into a specific
     page number. You will be asked for the new page number, and if it's
     valid, you will be taken there.
     
         O - Sort: This command allows you to perform sortings on either
     the file list or the disk list. When you press O, a submenu will
     appear, containing three options:
     
         F - Sort File list: sorts the file list alphabetically. The
     sorting may take up to more than one minute if the list contains many
     filenames.
     
         D - Sort Disk list: sorts the disk list alphabetically. This means
     that the order of the files in the list will not be affected, only the
     disks' numbers will change to reflect that the disk list is now in
     alphabetical order.  When the sorting finishes, a message will appear
     asking if you want to automatically execute the following option
     (reorder files according to disk number).
     
         R - Reorder files according to disk number: This option will
     change the order of the files in the list, so the files from disk #1
     will be grouped at the beginning of the list, followed by the files
     from disk #2, and so on.
     
         CLR - Clear list: Pressing SHIFT-CLR/HOME causes the program to
     ask you if you really want to erase all the list from memory. If you
     answer Y, all the list will be erased. BE CAREFUL! This is absolutely
     irrecoverable.
     
         # - Change disk number: SC128 numbers the disks as they are
     entered in the list. To renumber them, use this option. You will be
     asked to enter the new disk number (as always, you can cancel with
     ESC). The diskname will actually be moved inside the disk list, pretty
     much the way the filenames are moved with the M key. All other disk
     numbers will be adjusted accordingly.
     
         F - Free mem: Is exactly the same option as in directory mode.
     Refer to it for details.
     
         L/S - Load/Save list: Works exactly as in directory mode, but it
     returns you to list mode after completing its operation.
