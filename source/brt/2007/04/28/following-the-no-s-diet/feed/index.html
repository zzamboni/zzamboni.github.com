		<description>&lt;p&gt;Senia: it is the &quot;Fancy Pull Quotes&quot; plugin. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/2007/04/21/fancy-pull-quotes-plugin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joaquin: good to hear from you! I have also started going to the gym several times per week. I&#039;ve never been really fat, but I did get &quot;chubby&quot; :-) while I was living in the U.S., and it has really taken me a while to lose some of that weight.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi ZZamboni, 
Question for you - how do you get that cool &quot;quote like&quot; thing to appear on your site.  You&#039;re using wordpress for the blog.  Is that large-quote a plugin?  I&#039;m thinking of using something like that for a news site that I edit (www.pos-psych.com).   Found you from your comment on ZenHabits. Thank you so much,
Senia&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Diego:
I remember you were not fat. By the way, I like the Zone Diet from Dr. Sears. Although I dont follow it strictly I do not drink sodas, and other junk food. The  main problem is that I have to eat outside home, and the  restorants´s food here  lacks  of vegetables and fruit, and is plenty of trans fat and carbohydrates.
So, I usually prepare my own food to go.
I also go to the gym four times a week.
Regards&lt;/p&gt;
