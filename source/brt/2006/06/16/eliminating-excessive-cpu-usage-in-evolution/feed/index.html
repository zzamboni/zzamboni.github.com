		<description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s doing it right now, so I thought I&#039;d check back here.  FWIW I am on gentoo, using evo 2.6.1.  I just took your advice and went hunting for other silly things that might be causing these terrible freeze ups.  I only have one account configured (an exchange account).  I have no extraordinary Mail Preferences, but I am wondering if perhaps the OWA adaptor could be hangng me up server side.  I am going to reduce the frequency of mail checks from every 5 minutes down to like 15 minutes and see if the frequency of freeze ups reduces.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It is very annoying - I was about to stop using Evolution because of this. Maybe some other option is causing similar behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;My evo is doing the same thing, and has been for about a month.  However, I do not have this item checked, and I never have!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is killing me!  Every 30 seconds or so evo locks up, cpu spikes to ~100% for about 20 seconds or so.  During this time the evo screen won&#039;t repaint, that is, if I put another window over top of evo, then bring evo to the foreground, the contents of the evo window formerly covered do not repaint with the proper evo contents until this cpu seisure passes.  Everthing other app/process on the machine is still responsive during this time though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wht the heck is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
