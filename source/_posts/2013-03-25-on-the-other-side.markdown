About a year ago,
[Posterous was acquired by Twitter](http://blog.posterous.com/big-news). A
month ago, it was announced that it will be
[completely shut down by April 30th](http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous). I'll
spare you my rant about how the awesome customer service that
characterized Posterous pre-acquisition completely disappeared after
the acquisition :)

On a more practical note, Posterous' closing meant finding a new place
to host my blogs. There are many options (you can find many of them
described in the
[posthaven.com migration guide](http://blog.posthaven.com/the-posterous-migration-guide)),
but I decided to go the DIY way and move my blogs to
[Octopress](http://octopress.org), hosted on
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

I'll post shortly a guide on how I did the migration, but for now I
just want to post a first "Welcome" message here. If you are reading
this message, you are in the correct place, whether it's the website
or the RSS feed (I updated my FeedBurner feed to point to the new
site, so if you are subscribed to it, you shouldn't have to do
anything). All the old contents has been migrated, and links to my
blog posts should work unchanged.

There are still a few rough edges (some pages are still in the old
site theme), I'm still working on the migration of some parts of the
site. Please [let me know](/contact.html) if you find anything
broken.
