I am at Purdue to give a CFEngine talk and visit some old colleagues, here are some photos I took during a night walk right after checking into my hotel. I graduated in 2001, and the last time I visited was almost 10 years ago. Time really flies, there are many new things in campus (including the shiny new Computer Science Building, which I had never seen), but so many others remain unchanged. It's awesome to be back.<p></p>
