<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">COMMANDMENTS<br><ol>
<li>Work on one thing at a time until finished.</li>
<li>Start no more new books, add no more new material to "Black Spring."</li>
<li>Don't be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.</li>
<li>Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!</li>
<li>When you can't <em>create</em> you can <em>work</em>.</li>
<li>Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.</li>
<li>Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.</li>
<li>Don't be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.</li>
<li>Discard the Program when you feel like itâ€”but go back to it next day. <em>Concentrate</em>. <em>Narrow down</em>. <em>Exclude</em>.</li>
<li>Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you <em>are</em> writing.</li>
<li>Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.</li>
</ol>
