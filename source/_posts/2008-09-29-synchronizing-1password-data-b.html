I am a big fan of the incredibly useful <a href="http://1password.com/">1Password</a>. The latest beta release (2.8.3.BETA-11) <a href="http://support.agilewebsolutions.com/showthread.php?p=66775">introduces a new keychain format</a> that, among other things, allows 1Password to detect changes made to the file by other programs and reload the changes on the fly. I am using this now to keep my 1P data synchronized between my work and personal accounts on my machine. Here's what I did:<p></p>
<div>
<ol class="MailOutline">
<li>In my work account (dza), switch to the AgileKeyChain format by <a href="http://support.agilewebsolutions.com/showthread.php?p=66775">following the instructions</a>.</li>
<li>Modify the ACL for my ~/Library/Application Support/1Password/ folder to allow my personal account (zamboni) read/write access. I did this using the "Sharing &amp; Permissions" section of the Info dialog for the folder, and then choosing "Apply to enclosed items" from the cogwheel menu in that same section.</li>
<li>Switch to my personal account.</li>
<li>Quit 1Password, run the defaults command from the instructions, restart 1Password.</li>
<li>Export my existing 1Password data in the "1Password Interchange file" format. To do this, choose File -&gt; Export all -&gt; 1Password Interchange File, and save it to a file in my desktop.</li>
<li>Double click /Users/dza/Library/Application Support/1Password/1Password.agilekeychain and click "yes" to start using that file.</li>
<li>Import the data from step 5: File -&gt; Import, and follow the prompts. Wait for the data to import.</li>
<li>Switch back to my work account and verify that the imported items are seen there as well.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<div>This is incredibly useful. I had been trying to use the <a href="https://my.1password.com/">my1Password</a> service to achieve this, but the service is still not very mature and I had been unsuccessful. With this, I can access my data from both accounts without having to send the data through the network or use any third-party services, which is great.</div>
