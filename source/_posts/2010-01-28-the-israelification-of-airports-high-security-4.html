      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Israelis, unlike Canadians and Americans, don't take s--- from anybody. When the security agency in Israel (the ISA) started to tighten security and we had to wait in line for — not for hours — but 30 or 40 minutes, all hell broke loose here. We said, 'We're not going to do this. You're going to find a way that will take care of security without touching the efficiency of the airport.</blockquote>

    <p>Very interesting article about doing airport security when you face real, constant threats, and how to do it without ridiculous and time-consuming measures that are only useful to further promote the security theater.</p>
