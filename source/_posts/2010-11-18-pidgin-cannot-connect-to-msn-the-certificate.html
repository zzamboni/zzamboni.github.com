    <p>Like many people, I started getting certificate errors when connecting to my MSN account using Pidgin. The straightforward fix described (delete certificate, reconnect to fetch the new one) didn't work for me with Pidgin 2.7.5 under Windows 7, but this slightly-more-convoluted technique worked fine.</p>
