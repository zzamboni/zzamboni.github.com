I want to post a short update aimed at users of my iPhoto plugin <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/code/copperexport/" target="_blank">CopperExport</a>. I have received multiple reports of it failing in recent updates of Snow Leopard, and I have also verified personally that it does not work properly in iPhoto'09.<br><div class="gmail_quote"> <br>Unfortunately, since <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/after-the-move" target="_blank">the big move</a>, I find myself without easy access to a Mac for development (I had a Mac at my previous job, and I use Windows at my new job), which pretty much makes fixing these bugs impossible. Until I get a new machine, I will not be able to provide updates to CopperExport. Of course, if any developers out there want to make the appropriate fixes, I will happily accept patches that you submit, and produce a new release myself.<p></p> I apologize to my users for this not-so-happy state, and I want to assure you that as soon as possible, I will resume development. Thank you for your patience and your support, and for the many kind words you have sent me about the plugin itself.<p></p>  </div>
