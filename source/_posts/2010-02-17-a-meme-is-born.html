<blockquote>
<div>
<strong><br> I am rugged - and more importantly, my code is rugged.</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.</p>
<p>I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.</p>
<p>I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.</p>
<p>I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.</p>
<p>I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary… and I am up for the challenge.</p>

<p>This is important. We need to stop building fragile software, stop repeating the same mistakes that have caused vulnerabilities and failures for decades, and we need to teach software developers the importance of building rugged software.</p>
