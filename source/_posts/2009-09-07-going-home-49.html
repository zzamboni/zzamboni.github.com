Thirteen years ago, I left Mexico to <a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~zamboni/">study a Ph.D.</a> in the U.S. In the meantime, apart from doing that, I <a href="http://fotos.zzamboni.org/displayimage.php?pos=-1596">got married</a>, we <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~dza/">moved to Switzerland</a>, and we formed a <a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/2006/02/16/karina-aileen/">beautiful</a> <a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/2008/09/08/fabiola-aimee/">family</a>. I have learned so many things, I have changed in so many ways. In the words of <a href="http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/">my advisor</a>, during one of our very early email exchanges, before I went to Purdue:<p></p>
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><i>It isn't so much a leaving as a beginning of something else.  When you return, as you will, it will be with a more wordly viewpoint.  That is both a loss and a gain.</i></blockquote>
<br><div>Now, after all these years, it's time to go home.</div>
<p></p>
<div>At the end of October, we will be moving back to Mexico, to live in the beautiful colonial city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quer%C3%A9taro,_Quer%C3%A9taro">Queretaro</a>. I will take a very interesting job offer, which I will tell you about at the proper time.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Going back to Mexico is something Susana and I always said we wanted to do eventually, and this seems like the perfect opportunity to actually do it. The girls are still young, we are going back with a solid job offer, and to live in a very nice city. We are truly excited to go back. Still, it's not without some mixed feelings. We have been out of our home country for so long, that I think it's inevitable there will be some reverse culture shock. Switzerland is a beautiful, nice and safe country, which has given us a lot, and I very much like my job here. Still, I jump from joy every time I think we will be back in our home country, every time I realize there won't be any more harsh winters, every time I think I'll be able to eat Mexican food anytime I want, and so many other things I miss. Going back just feels so good!</div>
<p></p>
<div>The next step, of course, is to execute the plan. We are already waist-deep in preparations, planning, searching, and so many other things. It's an exciting time. Stay tuned.</div>
