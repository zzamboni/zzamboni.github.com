<p>In their quest to offer a better service every day, the guys at <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous.com</a> have released their <a href="">Pages tool</a>, which makes it much easier to use Posterous for all my online content by allowing the creation of static pages. And in a <strong>stroke of genius</strong>, they even allow pages to automatically redirect to arbitrary URLs! This makes it almost trivial to integrate multiple sites into a single, unified user experience. As a first step, as you can see above, I have better integrated this blog and my <a href="http://posterous.zzamboni.org/">zznippets</a>Â blog by giving them a common theme, differentiated only by color. I will be working on bringing much of my other online content under posterous by making use of this feature.</p>

<div>Thanks to the posterous team for offering such a great service!</div>
