    <p>Scary video (entertaining in a schadenfreude way). I found it unsettling that the "horizon" in the video doesn't move (as it would in a movie scene, for example, to have you notice how much the boat is moving) since the camera is moving with the ship, but you can infer the violence of the swaying from the damage it caused. /via @benthemorrison on Twitter.</p>
