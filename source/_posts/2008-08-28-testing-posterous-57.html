<p>Posterous looks quite nice, with the ability to "do the right thing" for different media types, and to autopost to other places. I have just set it up to autopost to my blog (<a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/">http://zzamboni.org/brt/</a> ), we'll see if it does the right thing. </p>
<p></p>  It should also auto-post to Flickr, so here goes a test photo.
