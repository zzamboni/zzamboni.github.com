<p>This time iâ€™m going to talk about the basic components that make up a physics engine and how to put them together; this tutorial is aimed at programmers who have a basic grasp of maths and geometry but would like to step into the world of simulation.</p>
<p>It is my hope that if, at the beginning of this article, you are able to code the physics behind the 1972 game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>,  by the end of the article you will be equally happy writing your own constraints to use in your own physics solver!</p>
