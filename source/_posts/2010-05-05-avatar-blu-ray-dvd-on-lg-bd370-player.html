Just for the record, the Avatar Blu-Ray DVD plays correctly on my LG BD370 player, with the latest firmware (V7.170.00.26, upgraded from the device). I get a message saying "your player may need an upgrade", then the screen goes black, but after about 45 seconds, the DVD menu appears and you can play the movie correctly.<p></p>
<div>The first time I watched it, the black screen freaked me out, I didn't wait too long, and ended up watching the movie from the regular DVD. I haven't yet watched the whole movie in Blu-Ray, but from the few scenes I watched, the difference is noticeable and the quality is amazing.</div>
