<p><em>The basic unit of work in the Pomodoro Techniqueâ„¢ can be split
                        in five simple steps:</em> </p>
                <ol>
<li><span>Choose a task to be accomplished</span></li>
                    <li><span>Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the
                            timer)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put
                            a check on your sheet of paper</span></li>
                    <li><span>Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break</span></li>
</ol>

    <p>I'm giving the Pomodoro Technique a try today for my work. Looks like a nice way to split time, and a nice complement to GTD as a mechanism for the "doing" part of it.</p>
