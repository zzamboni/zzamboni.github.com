<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Whenever you look at a firewall rule, half the time you’re going to be asking yourself, “Why is that there?  Did *I* put it there?  Do we still need it?”  It would sure be nice if the explanation were right there, as a comment that could be version-tracked, exported into nice reports, searched on, and placed in a standard format that would be compatible with other exception entries in other tools.  (Kind of like a syslog for exceptions.)  It would be nice if you could mark a scanner finding as, “We KNOW it’s there.  We’re not going to fix it.  Just for these two machines, STOP REPORTING ON THIS.”)</blockquote>

<p>Insightful article. I can't count the number of times I have asked myself exactly this, and hoped for a good, INTEGRATED way of keeping track of these exceptions.</p>
