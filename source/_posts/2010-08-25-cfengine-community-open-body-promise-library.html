<p>I have created a <a href="http://github.com/zzamboni/cfengine-copbl">copy of the cfengine COPBL on GitHub</a> , where I will use it as a playground for changes and additions. This is in no way endorsed by cfengine - it is just my personal copy. But if you use GitHub and want to use it, go ahead, I will try to keep it updated with respect to <a href="http://www.cfengine.org/pages/develop">the original subversion repository</a> , although it will include my changes too. </p>
<p></p> Visit the <a href="http://www.cfengine.org/pages/starterkit">COPBL web page</a> for more information. <p></p> Hopefully at some point the cfengine people themselves will host the COPBL at GitHub, then I should be able to remove my repository and just fork theirs.
