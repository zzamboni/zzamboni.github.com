If you have been using myÂ <a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/2007/12/17/how-to-define-a-new-wallet-item-in-1password/">method for defining new wallet items in 1Password</a>, you may have noticed that in recent versions the display of those new items has been broken. I have updated the instructions and the script to work with the recent changes, you can get it from the same page.
