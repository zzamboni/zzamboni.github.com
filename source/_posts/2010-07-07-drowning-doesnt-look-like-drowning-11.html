<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult.  In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening (source: CDC).  Drowning does not look like drowning</blockquote>

    <p>This is an eye-opening article for me. Not having actually watched anyone drown (fortunately), I had the impression that someone drowning would trash madly as shown on TV and movies. This is knowledge that can actually save lives! I think everyone should read this, particularly parents.</p>
