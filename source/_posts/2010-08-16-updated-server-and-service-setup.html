<p>(a friend asked me about my online setup, and I wrote the text below. Then I realized it would also make an interesting blog post, and I just copied and pasted it, with minimal editing, into an email to posterous. This is why I love posterous, it makes posting so easy) </p>
<p></p> For my setup, I have a hodgepodge of stuff all aggregated under the <a href="http://zzamboni.org/">zzamboni.org</a> domain. I wrote a blog post about my setup some time ago: <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/server-less-does-not-mean-service-less">http://blog.zzamboni.org/server-less-does-not-mean-service-less</a> <p></p> Since then, the main things that have changed is that now my static content (e.g. <a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/">http://zzamboni.org/brt/</a>) is also served by <a href="http://github.com/">github</a>, instead of Google AppEngine + drydrop. Github used to offer hosting of custom domains only for paid accounts, but now it's available to free accounts as well, so I decided to simplify the setup and host them directly on github. I also just moved the grabcartoons web page to github as well (<a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/">http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/</a>). So now I have: <p></p> <a href="http://zzamboni.org/">http://zzamboni.org/</a> and <a href="http://zzamboni.org/brt/">http://zzamboni.org/brt/</a> hosted by github from my zzamboni.github.com repository. <br><a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/">http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/</a> hosted by github from the grabcartoons repository. <br><a href="http://zzamboni.org/things2thl/">http://zzamboni.org/things2thl/</a> hosted by github from the things2thl repository. <br><a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/">http://blog.zzamboni.org/</a> and <a href="http://posterous.zzamboni.org//">http://posterous.zzamboni.org//</a> (plus some other private blogs) hosted by posterous.com. This is my favorite site for blogging, since it's extremely easy to post by email, plus you can configure it to auto-post content to twitter, flicker, facebook, etc. <br>Email served by Google Apps. <p></p> I'm very happy with <a href="">posterous.com</a> and <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>. They are my two favorite services these days.
