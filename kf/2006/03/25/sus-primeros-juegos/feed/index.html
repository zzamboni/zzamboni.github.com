		<description>Wow. Kari is a new generation baby! I think I would be scared to death waking up and seeing all those flowers/animals... dangling just above my head about to attack me... but maybe it&#039;s just my primal instinct (no, I&#039;m not arachnophobic, but still).

The fourth picture from the left is my favorite. Does Diego need a simlar toy to &quot;keep him awake during the day for he does not fall asleep&quot;? Maybe we should install one in his office as well ;-)</description>
