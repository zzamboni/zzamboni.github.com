    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Evernote introduced some time ago an &#8220;Insert Date&#8221; keyboard shortcut, which is very handy. However, the options for the format of the inserted date seemed limited (only four options). I finally learned how this works, and how to change it on the Mac. The formats offered are those that are configured in the &#8220;Languages &amp; Text&#8221; preferences panel. If you go to &#8220;Region&#8221; and then click the &#8220;Customize button&#8221; in the Dates part of the panel, you will see and be able to customize the formats for short, medium, long and full date representations. Those are the options that are offered to you by Evernote. Just change them to whatever you want, and they will be available for selection. What I specifically wanted to do was to use the YYYY-MM-DD format, so I changed it to the following:<p></p>
<div>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<a href="http://zzamboni.github.com/images/2012/11/13/howto-changing-the-available-display-formats/45777298-System%20Preferences.jpg"><img alt="System_preferences" height="412" src="http://zzamboni.github.com/images/2012/11/13/howto-changing-the-available-display-formats/45777298-System%20Preferences.jpg" width="500"></a>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>I had to restart Evernote for it to recognize the change, but afterward the new formats were available.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Tip of the hat to Martin Maiers in the Evernote forums, who explained this technique: <a href="http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/29812-insert-date-formats-please-add-iso-8601/#entry160872">http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/29812-insert-date-formats-please-add-iso-8601/#entry160872</a>

I will be talking about using CFEngine as part of your security infrastructure. My colleague Joe Netzel will be talking about migration from CFEngine 2 to CFEngine 3, so if you are using CF2 and have been considering (or dreading) the migration, make sure to come by! Aleksey Tsalolikhin will give an introductory class to CFEngine. And Mark Burgess will give a class not related to CFEngine, but to the perils and skills needed to survive as a technical person in the &#8220;business world&#8221;.<p></p>

I graduated in 2001, and the last time I visited was almost 10 years ago. Time really flies, there are many new things in campus (including the shiny new Computer Science Building, which I had never seen), but so many others remain unchanged.

    <link href="http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/changing-message-protocol-handler-from-sparro"/>
    <updated>2012-01-25T09:54:07-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/changing-message-protocol-handler-from-sparro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[After using <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a> for a while, I have decided to switch back to Mail.app. However, even after setting my default email client to Mail.app, all my message: links (for example, from messages dragged from Mail.app into <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>) were opening in Sparrow.<p></p>
<div>After some experimentation, I figured out what happened: I switched the default email client from Sparrow to Mail using Mail&#8217;s preference panel:</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<a href="http://zzamboni.github.com/images/2012/01/25/changing-message-protocol-handler-from-sparro/37129835-PastedGraphic-1.png"><img alt="Pastedgraphic-1" height="125" src="http://zzamboni.github.com/images/2012/01/25/changing-message-protocol-handler-from-sparro/37129835-PastedGraphic-1.png" width="500"></a>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Apparently this switches the application for the mailto: protocol, but not for message:, nor for .eml files. The solution was to <b>use Sparrow&#8217;s preference panel</b> to set it again as the default email client, and then disable it. Then Sparrow correctly sets all the protocol handlers back to their default values.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <em>Steve Jobs</em> by Walter Isaacson. I thoroughly enjoyed it (I may post a longer review later on, but I really liked learning the &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; of much of what I witnessed from the outside over so many years). </p>
<p></p> With this book, for the first time, I decided to conduct an experiment. I got the book as an audiobook (from Audible, playing on my iPhone), as an ebook (using Kindle on my iPhone) and also the hardcover physical book. This allowed me to read the hardcover book when at home, to read the ebook whenever I was around and had some quiet time, or to listen to the audiobook when I was moving around (walking, driving, working out, etc.). <p></p> It worked quite well. Having multiple means of consuming the book allowed me to finish it in a shorter time, and also to experience the differences of each media type. Overall, for the sheer pleasure of reading, I think I still prefer reading on paper. But I really appreciate not having to carry the heavy book everywhere I go, and to be able to continue &#8220;reading&#8221; even when I could not focus my eyes on the book. <p></p> My one wish: synchronization! It would be great if the Kindle book and the Audible audiobook would synchronize among them, so that one would skip to wherever I stopped on the other (like what Kindle does when you read the same book across multiple devices).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday my external Western Digital disk (which I use for Time Machine, among other things) stopped mounting automatically when I plug it in. This may *cough*definitely*cough*have something to do with me unmounting it forcefully while it was doing a backup, since I was in a hurry.</p>
<div>Disk Utility reported everything was OK with the disk, but it still failed to mount. Upon poking a bit deeper, I found these messages in the logs:</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">12/14/11 11:49:00.000 PM kernel: jnl: disk2s2: <strong>open: journal magic is bad</strong> (0x0 != 0x4a4e4c78)</span></div>

</div>
<p></p>
<div>Aha! Journal error. A bit of Google searching led me to <a href="http://dmunsie.wordpress.com/code/hacks/">this page</a>, where one comment gave me the key:</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">root# mkdir /tmp/disk &amp;&amp; mount_hfs -j /dev/disk2s2 /tmp/disk</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">root# diskutil disableJournal /tmp/disk</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">An error occurred journaling the file system: The underlying task reported failure on exit (-69860)</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">root# diskutil enableJournal /tmp/disk</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> </span>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">Journaling was already enabled for volume Casa on disk2s2</span></div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: Courier New;">Volume Casa on disk2s2 unmounted</span></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Despite the error in the &#8220;disableJournal&#8221; command, after this sequence the Finder was able to mount the disk, and things seem to be working fine. The trick in the first command is the -j option, since it allows the disk to be mounted (without journaling), so that the disableJournal/enableJournal commands can be issued.</div>

<p>Quick note: The first screen is my most-used apps (some are going out now, like 2Do which I&#8217;ve never liked too much, but was the best way to sync tasks with Outlook, which I&#8217;m no longer forced using). Second screen is all my folders. Third and fourth screens are my girls&#8217; screens, with the games they use when they borrow my phone. The games I play are mostly in the first &#8220;Games&#8221; folder.</p>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<a href="https://cfengine.com/">CFEngine</a> is both the oldest and the newest of the popular tools for automating site administration.  Mark Burgess invented it as a free software project in 1993, and years later, as deployments in the field outgrew its original design he gave it a complete rethink and developed the powerful concept of <a href="http://research.iu.hio.no/promises.php">promise theory</a> to make it modular and maintainable.</blockquote>

    <p>I contributed to this article by Andy Oram on CFEngine 3. It talks about the history of CFEngine 3, why it is a powerful tool for system administrators, and what is new in the latest releases of both the commercial and the open-source versions of CFEngine.</p>

    <link href="http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/new-job-new-book"/>
    <updated>2011-10-19T00:21:07-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/new-job-new-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Today I have two big announcements to make.<p></p>
<div>First, as of this week I have a new job, I am now working with <a href="http://cfengine.com/">CFEngine AS</a>, the company that develops and maintains <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">cfengine</a>. As you know if you read my blog, I am a big fan of cfengine. It is a mature and able tool that provides extreme flexibility and power to system administrators. The company is full of energy and with very interesting projects to make cfengine even better and more popular than it is today. I am very happy to be working with such a talented team. I will be working with the Products and Services group in a variety of roles and projects, about some of which you may be able to read here as well.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Second, and not entirely unrelated, I have been working in the last few months in a book titled <b>Learning CFEngine 3</b>. The book will be published by <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly</a>, and should come out sometime early next year. I can&#8217;t tell you how excited I am to be writing a book for O&#8217;Reilly! I have learned so much from O&#8217;Reilly books throughout the years, so it is truly an honor to be able to join such select company and to contribute something back to the community. The book is a personal project and not part of my job at CFEngine, although of course working at the mothership makes things much easier in many respects, and my new colleagues are incredibly supportive of this project.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So, that&#8217;s it for now. Big changes and big projects. I am very busy and very excited, and will keep you posted on both fronts. Thank you for reading!</div>

    <link href="http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/dennis-m-ritchie-rip"/>
    <updated>2011-10-13T00:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/dennis-m-ritchie-rip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Ritchie passed away last weekend. He was one of the great minds in systems research and development, father of the C programming language, and one of the big contributors to Unix, both of which power the Mac on which I&#8217;m typing this, the iPhone on my desk, the Windows machine I use at work, the servers on which this blog is hosted, and much of the infrastructure both you and I use to connect to it.</p>
<p>May he Rest in Peace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This makes three consecutive obituaries in my blog, of three great minds that have passed away in the last couple of weeks. All three of them were giants in their fields, and their fields were related and interconnected. Dennis Ritchie built much of the foundations on which our current technologies are based; Gene Schultz worked tirelessly to make them more secure; and Steve Jobs worked tirelessly to make them a joy to use. </p>
<p></p> In my everyday work and life, even just here, in the devices on my desk, I can see and experience the work and passion of these three men. I feel honored to have met them, either in person or through their work.
