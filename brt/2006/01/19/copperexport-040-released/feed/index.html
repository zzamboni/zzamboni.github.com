		<description>&lt;p&gt;Jaap: thanks for letting me know. I will fix it as soon as I can get my hands on iLife&#039;08 (unfortunately I have no definite plans of buying it at the moment...)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel: the plugin should work. You can try applying the latest patch included with CopperExport to your Coppermine installation, and see if it works. I will produce a new release of the patch as soon as I come back from vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>Kenny - I think iPhoto2Gallery is based on CopperExport, which could be the cause for the crashes - please let the iPhoto2Gallery author know about that.

About your problem - can you upload photos and create albums from CopperExport&#039;s web interface?</description>

		<description>Hey, Thanks for making this plugin. I had some installation problems, but figured out the error. I had a previous plugin for iPhoto2Gallery, which seemed incompatible to CopperExport. Once I removed iPhoto2Gallery from the plugin folder, CopperExport came up in the Export dialog (previously it crashed iPhoto).

My problem that I am having now is not be able to connect to database. CopperExport says I have no permission and cannot create an Album.

I am using Coppermine 1.4.4 and have downloaded your latest CopperExport. Loaded the 1.4.3 php (as there isn&#039;t a 1.4.4).

Any ideals of what maybe going on?

Yes, I have admin prevliages and also made the Album folder 775 for permissions.

Stumped, Kenny Lim</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;NullMind - are you sure? This is exactly one of the things I changed back in 0.4.0, because many people complained about it. It now leaves the filename unchanged. Are you sure you are using the new version?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hi mate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when it does a resize of a file to upload, it is still renaming the file, wich is a problem if you using EXIF renamed files for date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anything that can be done ?&lt;/p&gt;
