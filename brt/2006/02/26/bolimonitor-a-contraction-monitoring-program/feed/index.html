		<description>Great program.  It&#039;s been very helpful this evening (my wife is in labour).  If I could only make one suggestion, the contraction interval time should be measured from start to start (ie: from the start of a contraction, to the start of the next contraction).  Of course, the ability to export data would also be nice, but I&#039;m sure that would require much more work.

Thanks,
Tony</description>
