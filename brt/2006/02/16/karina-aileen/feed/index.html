		<description>Brian - thanks for the comment and the good wishes! I wrote the software mostly to keep myself entertained during the wait ;-) my wife also thought it was too geeky. Good luck with the baby to you as well!</description>

Mostly I&#039;m just being bored and anxious waiting for labor to start... hahah...  Good luck with the new baby!</description>
