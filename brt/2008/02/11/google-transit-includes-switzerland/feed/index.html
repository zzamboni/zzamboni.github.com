		<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the ZVV site is really nice (I checked it out right after). I wish we would have a better bus system here in the US, but except for the cities you are dependend on cars.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Marlyse - thanks for the comment! I hope they will include better information in the future, otherwise it&#039;s hard to completely trust the system, and I guess one would always in the end check the SBB or ZVV sites for the definitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is actually pretty cool! As I am a Swiss (living in the US) I instantly went and checked out a route I used to take for 4 years. The result was very good but as you pointed out, it does not take into account the very dense bus options. It suggested that I first walk 18 minutes to the next train station and in the end walk again 8 minutes from the train station and calculated the total travel time with 40 minutes which is not bad considering this walking time which in fact was only a 3 minute walk to the bus and mid-way a switch from one bus to another one and at the end another 1 minute walk. The whole trip used to take me maybe 30 minutes (18 minutes with my little scooter if I hit a wave of green lights). Thoroughly enjoyed this link and news.&lt;/p&gt;
