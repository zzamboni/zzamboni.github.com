		<description>@Conrad: sorry to hear of your problems with CC support. As evidenced by my review, my experience has been quite different. I have gotten personal replies several times from CC in response to bug reports. Very helpful as well are the forums, since Things has a very active user community (and CC people also post frequently). 
 
I don&#039;t own an iPhone or iPod Touch, so I cannot comment on the sync capabilities. </description>

		<description>I followed this program for months hoping it would get better.  It has too many bugs, and what I&#039;d been waiting for, syncing with an iTouch, never seems to work right.  The cost is prohibitively high for a program with so many bugs.  I don&#039;t recommend it.  Or if you need a task organizer without the sync capability, just get the iTouch/iPhone version and forget the Mac desktop version. 
 
Also, their customer support is completely lacking.  I&#039;ve written them four times and never received a response.  For this reason alone, I would not purchase their program.  It is like paying money have being kicked in the teeth.  Far better to vote with your feet and chose a better application with customer support. </description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with GTD products I&#039;ve used is that a lot end up not being supported... e.g. Thinking Rock doesn&#039;t seem to be supported any more and ActionTastic has also died.  So I keep moving from one GTD to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that unless Apple create their own built-in GTD that is good, then it isn&#039;t worth risking your productivity on ANY third party company.  I want a promise that a third party company will continue development... sadly no third party company can promise that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to todolist.txt :(&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@Craig: thank you for the comment. I have not looked at Ready-Set-Do!, but it certainly looks interesting - I might have to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the review and the tip on dragging items into the Note field.  I love Things but I am still discovering some things about it because it was so easy to just using that I never read any directions on it.  I have tried at least a little bit just about everything else out there for the Mac.  Things is still evolving for me as I think about my system of tags.  That seems to be where Things either comes together in GTD or falls apart into just a to-do list program.  ThinkingRock is still on my machine to remind me of the rigorous GTD system. I don&#039;t actively use it.  I do still actively use the Mac only GTD system of scripts &quot;Ready-Set-Do!&quot; by Todd Vasquez http://homepage.mac.com/toddvasquez/Ready-Set-Do!/Personal93.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It Comprehensively integrates all of your files and programs into David Allen&#039;s GTD workflow without locking you into a particular program. So I  go back and forth between these scripts which help me practice the GTD system with little effort  and the program Things which thanks to the above tip I can use on my other account on the same system.  I think over time Ready-Set-Do! will help me work out how I will use Things tag system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also strongly recommend Neil Fiore&#039;s book to any GTD enthusiast, &quot;The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
