		<description>So far, it&#039;s zero false positives and negatives (though I also don&#039;t receive so many comments...). About the privacy issue - all the comments in your blog are available on the Internet anyway, so what&#039;s the problem? :-)</description>

		<description>Interesting... I have been using Spam Karma as my comment spam filter. SK uses a variety of classifiers and works very well for me, catching about 10 spam comments every two or three days with zero false positives and zero false negatives (well... I don&#039;t receive so many comments, so you can achieve similar figures with a very simple rule). 

As far as I know Aksimet sends all the comments to the central server. I see an advantage in it, but if one is a privacy freak... ;-)

BTW: it seems that thare is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sebbi.de/archives/2005/10/31/spam-karma-2-akismet-plugin-beta/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spam karma plugin for akismet&lt;/a&gt;. Wonder if it makes sense...</description>
