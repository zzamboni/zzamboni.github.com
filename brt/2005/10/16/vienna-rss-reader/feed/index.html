		<description>Well, two weeks later, and I&#039;m still using Vienna, it&#039;s actually quite nice. I&#039;m also still on Safari :-) One nice thing is that if you set Vienna as the default RSS reader, you can still press the blue &quot;RSS&quot; button on Safari, and it will open the feed on Vienna - very convenient.

About Google Mail - I read it through POP using Mail, and then it&#039;s fully searchable as well.</description>

		<description>good to hear another fellow experimenting with Vienna!  I&#039;ve been using it for about a week now and really like it.  mind you, I&#039;m intentionally on Panther so I haven&#039;t checked out Safari RSS yet.  happy to see Vienna and Camino co-mingle though.

Just figured out you can have Google Mail fed into Vienna - not too useful but does inspire new ideas - I am now dreaming about being able to search in the lower-righthand corner and having it search all my email :)</description>
