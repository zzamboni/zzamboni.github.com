    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><span>I have been blogging <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">about CFEngine</a> here for a while (it's my most frequent tag). As of now, I'm starting to post all CFEngine-related posts to <a href="http://blog.cf-learn.info/">http://blog.cf-learn.info/</a>, which is part of <a href="http://cf-learn.info/"></a><a href="http://cf-learn.info/">the web site for my book "Learning CFEngine 3"</a>. In this way, I intend to group all CFEngine-related content over there. I will still cross-post relevant things here, but if you want to stay fully up to date on my CFEngine writings, please subscribe over there as well.</span></div>

<div><span>I hope to see you around!</span></div>

    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/new-website-for-learning-cfengine-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to announce that the website for my book is now live at <a href="http://cf-learn.info/">http://cf-learn.info/</a>. </p>


<p></p>


<p> In this website you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>General information about the book. </li>
<li>A discussion forum for any type of questions, feedback or suggestions about the book. </li>
<li>Downloadable code examples from the book, plus (over time) many other new examples. </li>
<li>List of Errata, and access to the Errata system at O'Reilly </li>
<li>A blog devoted to the book and to CFEngine. </li>
</ul>


<p>The site is fairly empty at the moment (the blog, the forum and the errata page are live, I encourage you to participate, particularly if you have purchased the Early Release version of the book and want to provide any sort of feedback), but content will grow over time. </p>


<p></p>


<p> Check it out! And of course, let me know what you think.</p>
