    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>  Last night I made a new release of my comic aggregator script, &lt;a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/"&gt;grabcartoons&lt;/a&gt;. You can fetch it from it brand new &lt;a href="http://zzamboni.org/grabcartoons/"&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt;, now hosted by &lt;a href="http://github.com/zzamboni/grabcartoons/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt; instead of sourceforge.net.

      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I am not just a Linux enthusiast, I also happen to use Windows quite often. In fact, Windows is my primary desktop from which I connect to all the other boxes and do my work on. During the years of Windows usage, I have accumulated a list of must-have Windows programs that I wouldn’t be able to work without. Some of them are commercial, some are freeware, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is how productive you are with your setup. If you’re really productive on Linux with your own set of tools, it’s perfectly fine and you have done a great job of finding the best tools of trade.</blockquote>

    <p>Having recently moved to Windows as my main desktop OS (out of work requirement, not by wish), I have been trying to find good software that makes it a more pleasant environment. This list has many good recommendations.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
<strong><br> I am rugged - and more importantly, my code is rugged.</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.</p>
<p>I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.</p>
<p>I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.</p>
<p>I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.</p>
<p>I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary… and I am up for the challenge.</p>

<p>This is important. We need to stop building fragile software, stop repeating the same mistakes that have caused vulnerabilities and failures for decades, and we need to teach software developers the importance of building rugged software.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to post a short update aimed at users of my iPhoto plugin <a href="http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/code/copperexport/" target="_blank">CopperExport</a>. I have received multiple reports of it failing in recent updates of Snow Leopard, and I have also verified personally that it does not work properly in iPhoto'09.<br><div class="gmail_quote"> <br>Unfortunately, since <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/after-the-move" target="_blank">the big move</a>, I find myself without easy access to a Mac for development (I had a Mac at my previous job, and I use Windows at my new job), which pretty much makes fixing these bugs impossible. Until I get a new machine, I will not be able to provide updates to CopperExport. Of course, if any developers out there want to make the appropriate fixes, I will happily accept patches that you submit, and produce a new release myself.<p></p> I apologize to my users for this not-so-happy state, and I want to assure you that as soon as possible, I will resume development. Thank you for your patience and your support, and for the many kind words you have sent me about the plugin itself.<p></p>  </div></p>
