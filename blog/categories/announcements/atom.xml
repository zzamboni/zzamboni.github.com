    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There will be several CFEngine-related classes and talks at the <a href="http://www.picconf.org/">PICC'12 conference</a> (Professional IT Community Conference) on May 11-12th, in New Jersey. I will be talking about using CFEngine as part of your security infrastructure. My colleague Joe Netzel will be talking about migration from CFEngine 2 to CFEngine 3, so if you are using CF2 and have been considering (or dreading) the migration, make sure to come by! Aleksey Tsalolikhin will give an introductory class to CFEngine. And Mark Burgess will give a class not related to CFEngine, but to the perils and skills needed to survive as a technical person in the "business world".<p></p></p>

<div>If you are coming to the conference, we look forward to seeing you there!<br><ul>

    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/cfengine-posts-moving-to-cf-learninfo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><span>I have been blogging <a href="http://blog.zzamboni.org/tag/cfengine">about CFEngine</a> here for a while (it's my most frequent tag). As of now, I'm starting to post all CFEngine-related posts to <a href="http://blog.cf-learn.info/">http://blog.cf-learn.info/</a>, which is part of <a href="http://cf-learn.info/"></a><a href="http://cf-learn.info/">the web site for my book "Learning CFEngine 3"</a>. In this way, I intend to group all CFEngine-related content over there. I will still cross-post relevant things here, but if you want to stay fully up to date on my CFEngine writings, please subscribe over there as well.</span></div>


<p></p>


<div><span>I hope to see you around!</span></div>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[New website for "Learning CFEngine 3"]]></title>
    <link href="http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/new-website-for-learning-cfengine-3"/>
    <updated>2011-12-15T02:22:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://zzamboni.github.com/blog/new-website-for-learning-cfengine-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to announce that the website for my book is now live at <a href="http://cf-learn.info/">http://cf-learn.info/</a>. </p>


<p></p>


<p> In this website you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>General information about the book. </li>
<li>A discussion forum for any type of questions, feedback or suggestions about the book. </li>
<li>Downloadable code examples from the book, plus (over time) many other new examples. </li>
<li>List of Errata, and access to the Errata system at O'Reilly </li>
<li>A blog devoted to the book and to CFEngine. </li>
</ul>


<p>The site is fairly empty at the moment (the blog, the forum and the errata page are live, I encourage you to participate, particularly if you have purchased the Early Release version of the book and want to provide any sort of feedback), but content will grow over time. </p>


<p></p>


<p> Check it out! And of course, let me know what you think.</p>
