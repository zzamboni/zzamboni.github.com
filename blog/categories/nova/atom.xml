      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<a href="https://cfengine.com/">CFEngine</a> is both the oldest and the newest of the popular tools for automating site administration.  Mark Burgess invented it as a free software project in 1993, and years later, as deployments in the field outgrew its original design he gave it a complete rethink and developed the powerful concept of <a href="http://research.iu.hio.no/promises.php">promise theory</a> to make it modular and maintainable.</blockquote>

    <p>I contributed to this article by Andy Oram on CFEngine 3. It talks about the history of CFEngine 3, why it is a powerful tool for system administrators, and what is new in the latest releases of both the commercial and the open-source versions of CFEngine.</p>
