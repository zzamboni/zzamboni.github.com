<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Whenever you look at a firewall rule, half the time you’re going to be asking yourself, “Why is that there?  Did *I* put it there?  Do we still need it?”  It would sure be nice if the explanation were right there, as a comment that could be version-tracked, exported into nice reports, searched on, and placed in a standard format that would be compatible with other exception entries in other tools.  (Kind of like a syslog for exceptions.)  It would be nice if you could mark a scanner finding as, “We KNOW it’s there.  We’re not going to fix it.  Just for these two machines, STOP REPORTING ON THIS.”)</blockquote>

<p>Insightful article. I can't count the number of times I have asked myself exactly this, and hoped for a good, INTEGRATED way of keeping track of these exceptions.</p>

<div>
<strong><br> I am rugged - and more importantly, my code is rugged.</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.</p>
<p>I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.</p>
<p>I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.</p>
<p>I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.</p>
<p>I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.</p>
<p>I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.</p>
<p>I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary… and I am up for the challenge.</p>

<p>This is important. We need to stop building fragile software, stop repeating the same mistakes that have caused vulnerabilities and failures for decades, and we need to teach software developers the importance of building rugged software.</p>
