    <p>Short video of David Allen talking about the importance of the GTD tools you choose. Conclusion: the most important thing is that you choose a tool you actually use, because the moment you stop putting your stuff in it, it will stop working.</p>
<p>Timely for me as I rebuild my GTD toolbox and system this week.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had to copy a very large file (&gt;4GB) from a remote Windows share to my Windows 7 machine, over a very finicky connection (frequently-failing VPN over a slow Internet connection). A GUI copy didn't work because the connection dropped frequently. I tried <a href="http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/">Free Download Manager</a>, which was the recommended tool for the download, but surprisingly, it wasn't always able to restart the download after connectivity dropped.<p></p></p>

<div>Then a colleague pointed me to the "copy /z" command:</div>


<p></p>


<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">   /Z           Copies networked files in restartable mode.</blockquote>


<p></p>


<div>And this simple, built-in tool turned out to be the thing I needed. It was, every time, able to restart the download properly, and after a few times, it downloaded the file correctly.</div>


<p> <p></p></p>

<div>As you may know, I am a reluctant recent switcher to Windows, coming from Linux and Mac OS X. I confess I still have a condescending attitude to everything in Windows, but this teaches me a lesson: <b>it pays to know the native tools of the system you are using.</b> I had subconsciously dismissed the built-in DOS copy command as too primitive to work, but it turned out to have the capabilities I needed.</div>


<p> <p></p></p>

<div>A couple of tips:</div>


<div>
<ul>
<li>If you interrupt the command with Ctrl-C, it will delete the portion copied so far and you'll have to restart the copy from the beginning. If you must interrupt a copy, simply terminate the network connection (it will die with an error, but leave the copied-so-far file) or close the window where the command is running.</li> <li>When you restart it and it asks if you want to overwrite, you must answer "yes". You can also use the /Y flag.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I am not just a Linux enthusiast, I also happen to use Windows quite often. In fact, Windows is my primary desktop from which I connect to all the other boxes and do my work on. During the years of Windows usage, I have accumulated a list of must-have Windows programs that I wouldn’t be able to work without. Some of them are commercial, some are freeware, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is how productive you are with your setup. If you’re really productive on Linux with your own set of tools, it’s perfectly fine and you have done a great job of finding the best tools of trade.</blockquote>

    <p>Having recently moved to Windows as my main desktop OS (out of work requirement, not by wish), I have been trying to find good software that makes it a more pleasant environment. This list has many good recommendations.</p>
