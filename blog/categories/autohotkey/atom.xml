    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing I missed since I moved from a Mac (using The Hit List for GTD) to Outlook (using Jello Dashboard for GTD) was the availability of a global hot key that I could use to bring up a text entry box which I could use to quickly add things into my electronic Inbox, for later processing.</p>


<p>I have found a way to achieve this, and here is the setup I am using now:</p>


<p>The first component is <a href="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2007/03/01/getting-things-done-%E2%80%93-outlook-task-automation-with-powershell/">this PowerShell script</a> written by Lee Holmes, which takes as arguments the title of the task to add, and adds it to Outlook. I saved it as <code>Documents/Add-OutlookTask.ps1</code> in my home directory.</p>


<p>The second component is the ever-useful and amazing <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>. I added the following lines to my <code>Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk</code> file:</p>


<p></p>


<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/753333.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>


<p>This snippet assigns Win-space to open an input box, and uses whatever is typed in it as the task title to the Add-OutlookTask script. The task will be placed without any categories in the task list, so it appears automatically the next time I open my Jello Dashboard inbox. Here it is in action:</p>


<p></p>


<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Addtask" height="107" src="http://zzamboni.github.com/images/2010/12/23/setting-up-a-global-hotkey-to-add-tasks-to-ou/19022076-AddTask.png" width="391">
</div>




<p>I find this extremely useful, since I can press Win-space to add new tasks from any application, without having to switch to Outlook first. At some point I would like to explore the idea of making it smarter, like the quick-add keys in Things or THL for the Mac. This would include, for example, using some information from the currently-active application to prefill the task information. Examples would include using the subject line if an Outlook email is selected or the title of the current web page if a browser is open. Also nice would be to include any selected text automatically in the notes for the task, and maybe a link to the original item.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>  One of the most useful applications I have discovered since I had to switch to Windows as my main OS is OneNote, a really great note-taking application which I use for pretty much every data-storing and note-taking need. I use a OneNote notebook as part of my GTD inbox. Today's very simple tip is how to assign a keystroke for opening my Inbox notebook from anywhere in the system. Here are the steps:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><li>Download and install <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>, if you don't have it already (it's a really useful free application, well worth exploring).</li> <li>Add the following line to your default AutoHotKey.ahk file (normally in ~/Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk):<br><p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/566376.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p></p>

<br>


<p></li> <li>Re-run AutoHotKey so it re-reads the config file.</li> </ol> Make sure you change the path of the file you want to open, and also the key to which you bind it, if don't like Win-i.<p></p>  Of course, this is useful for one-key opening of any file you want.</p>
